       " 'originally posted at http iliveforreading blogspot com this one has been very high up on my to read list i mean the hype for illuminae was huge i couldnt go down my twitter feed without seeing a few mentions of the book every day goodreads was absolutely abuzz with this title every waiting on wednesday post seemed to feature this book i was really surprised when i received a copy in the mail it was great timing too it arrived just before i left for the airport heading off to my second year at university talk about good luck unfortunately though i couldnt even get to read the book during the semester there just wasnt enough time for me to do so with all the work heading my way it was such a shame that i only got to it now because this one is amazing ive previously read kaufmans these broken stars another collab novel that she wrote with meagan spooner and since it was set in space too and was friggin awesome i knew that this one would be out of this world literally my friend borrowed this one from me and constantly gushed about it nonstop so i knew that i had to read this one fast so far is off to a fantastic start because ive been reading nothing but amazing books glad this one could join the list the format was mind blowing ive never had this much fun reading a book well okay it wasnt too much fun because it got serious at parts but the format just went up and beyond every expectation i had however this book was so huge i couldnt get through it in one sitting also i spent absolutely ages just looking at the details on the pages such as the mock wiki articles and the chats the censored material was brilliant and realistic sticking to the protocol and it was fun seeing how many blacked out words there were per page i was just a bit sad because some pages were missing artwork and some internal tears were shed when the words artwork tk would appear on the page ah oh well this just means that i should get a finished copy wink wink kady and ezra are such kickass characters i love how the story actually starts with them breaking up because its rare to see a book where the female and male counterpart or just the love interests in general are or have been in a relationship with each other i liked that both kaufman and kristoff have a pretty good handle on how teens talk and message each other it made reading the ims and various other forms of communication a whole lot better you also do get to learn about quite a few other characters that have interesting positions onboard the two ships aidan was actually super creepy but cool i got some major space odyssey feels from it and i actually think theres a reference embedded in there i did however get mixed up with people from time to time just because of random im names the various people who got promoted or demoted and so ranks changed it just made it confusing as to who was on what side there some really big twists that come your way things seem one way but they totally turn out different in the end true for most of the twists you seriously have no idea whats going to happen the deadly plague that breaks out creates a major problem and leads to terrifying consequences like i said aidan is super interesting to read about the pages about the ai were fascinating to read the reactions from other people on the ship also get heard but its just little snippets and tidbits here and there hopefully you can tell how pumped i am about this book illuminae is an experience like none other a gripping story of survival presented in an incredible visual format kaufman and kristoff have created an epic story that readers wont be able to put down i cant wait to read the rest of the trilogy as even though we wont be returning to kady and ezras perspectives well gain more insight into the world of the illuminae files and the events that transpired in this novel from other perspectives fall cannot get here fast enough thank you so much to aisha at random house childrens books for sending me a copy for review',\n",

       " 'for those of you who have read the first book in this series grave mercy get ready for an even better story and more impressive heroine in dark triumph if you who havent read the first installment and this is your initial foray into the his fair assassin series get ready for a dark ride through a medieval world full of tension schemes and action in this second addition to the series sybella is the leading lady assassin who has been forced back into the midst of her family by the abbess of the convent where she serves death which is as good as being thrown into a nest of snakes she is driven to the brink of insanity by her past but must now face those memories on a day to day basis as she tries to thwart the plots of the duke dalbret and his efforts to corner a young duchess into marriage to lay claim to her lands and right to the throne all of this changes when she rescues the beast of waroch a man who is different than her in every way possible from size to temperament as they journey back to the duchess court sybella finds salvation in the most unexpected of places and gathers the courage to finally put an end to guilt of her past first off i loved sybella in my eyes she was an immense improvement as the main heroine compared to ismae from the first book despite being a handmaiden of death sybella is haunted and scared devoid of any true concern for herself but seeking atonement for past sins by doing every miniscule thing she can to stop the duke and the man that society believes is her father theres a darkness to her that i thought was completely missing from ismae in grave mercy what can i say when i read about an assassin i want to see some edge and obscurity to them overall the whole book had a much more sinister feeling then the first one did which is what i would expect from a book about assassins and young women who are the enact the justice of death there are some really dark issues in this book emotional manipulation murder incest there were some points where i was surprised that lafevers went as far as she did in some directions especially considering this is a book for young adults and even more so with how light hearted the first book seemed in reflection but dark triumph seems to be jam packed with darker issues making up for some of the disappointment from the first novel the time period of the book is also one that i hold close to heart i have a masters in medieval studies so when i think of conniving courts oppressive lords and peasant society taken to the extreme in fiction this is what i hope to read i was also impressed to see that love and the act of falling in love didnt become such a central focus until later in the story it is a teen novel after all so i knew love would enter into the thick of things sooner or later but i was pleased with lafevers for holding off as long as she did i liked sybella being hard and cold and to have her fall head over heels in love like some fainting princess would have cheapened her character and ultimately after reading the horror story that has been her life you cant help but want love for sybella in the end i was somewhat skeptical after reading the first book grave mercy because it seemed to lack the deadly luster i had been hoping for but dark triumph as just as dark as i had hoped for that darkness is the series redeeming factor for me i can only hope that it continues in the third book mortal heart which is due out in the spring of if you like a story full of action and a heroine that is dangerous as much as she is flawed dark triumph is a great place to satisfy that itch devon athousandbooklife please come check out more of my reviews at my blog http athousandbooklife wordpress com',\n",

       " 'eleven is my favorite number and this stems from the fact that i had a lot of groundbreaking and painful experiences around that age consequently matt smith as the doctor became my instant favorite and it just so happened that he was introduced as the eleventh once steven moffat took over the bbc sci fi show these inane coincidences always make me giddy and now it has happened again with this clusterfuck issue numbered eleventh as well as a summary all i can really say is holyshit awesomesauce last issue present day cyclops is the leader of a new radical mutant movement where a revolution is a necessity that calls for his species prosperity regardless of the human factor that would play into it by his side are his on and off paramour emma frost the white queen and formidable telepath the dark magic wielding enchantress illyanna also known as magik and his enemy turned ally erik lehnsherr the mutant terrorist infamously known as magneto basically the perfect dream team amirite its a comforting thought so these awesome assholes crashed the jean grey school of higher learning but not because they want to be dicks well maybe just cyke he was there to inform any young hopefuls that their dream team i will now sarcastically refer to them from now on as the dream team is recruiting and it would be in their best interest if they join the crusade understandably the more seasoned x men like wolverine kitty pryde and storm are upset about this given that the man whom they used to call friend and leader just murdered their beloved mentor charles xavier back when cyke was possessed by the phoenix force cyke makes no half hearted apologies and simply states that yall know if i was in my right state of mind i aint have killed the prof yo well not in those words exactly but you get the gist the ocf original core five just stood there absolutely horrified and dumbfounded as the dream team stated their objective and a few words were exchanged between cyke and beast and then beast and young scott and then finally scott and scott which were all insightful dialogue exchanges the only people who joined the recruitment were emmas creepy triplet apprentices whom no one is going to miss anyway as cyke gives some last call announcement an unexpected individual steps into the spotlight and declares that he will join the dream team and its no other than the young warren a k a angel of the ocf ive guessed that he would turncoat like this well not so much as turncoat but more of doing something reckless so he can express his objection apathy and slight anger towards his friends by completely joining the dark side just so he can make a statement most importantly it was his decision to make he was out voted by his other comrades regarding their stay here in the present timeline and after meeting his amnesiac future self warren understood that he is not having any more of this twisted shit if he cant go home he sure as hell wont be staying in a place where he is not uncomfortable to be a part of sadly as sure as everything else warren once again feels misplaced which is essentially this characters central conflict from the very beginning its not that he wants to join cyke because he believes in his bullshit in fact warren stated bluntly that both sides are spewing nonsense but he preferred cykes nonsense better because it was honest at least but its more likely because warren wants to have the free will to choose by himself something which was tragically robbed from him by no other than jean grey from issue who telepathically prevented him from using the time cube so he can go home to demonstrate this tyrannical bitchiness jean once again uses telepathy to basically ground warren so he can go to his room what happened afterwards did not go well of course i mean srsly jeanie what the fuck needs to be asked twice in one breath since jean refused to listen to kitty emma herself who is a telepath felt the need to teach the young jean a lesson on privacy and free will so she ordered her apprentices to dig into jeans mind and punish her for her insolence and yeah thats when things get really messed up in a way only an x men story can get messed up behold the clusterfuckness anyone still breathing normally after reading that yeah me neither and can you imagine how pissed more so jean is going to be once she discovers that emma frost the woman who tried to murder her mind was is kind of scotts present squeeze at this point she was unable to read emmas mind and i dont think anyone would tell her about the relationship but pretty soon it will come up during casual conversation or when jean decides to spy on peoples thoughts again in any case i want more of these soap opera twists and turns i live for moments like this in x men stories you know i dont think this will be the last jean vs emma duel for this series dont be a baby you know you want it to happen again as well in any case warren says fuck yall especially you jeanie and disappears with the rest of the dream team kitty gets mad at beast and beast can only console himself by seeking affirmation that his decision was right by talking to his younger self who at least had his back its interesting to see how both versions of scott and hank are dealing with this crisis and i think the four of them should sit together in a room and really hash all their angst and issues with one another because man that would be some engrossing material right there because there are so many things they all want to say to each other and preferably thered be a little violence in that too im sorry i know i sound like a vulture right now but i just find every conflict for this series so delicious and complex and i cant help myself anyway we get yet another wonderful scene between young jean and kitty pryde and i think this is their best moment yet kitty has shown that she is the person to fill the missing role of charles xavier when it comes to guiding the ocf especially a troubled teenage jean who is burdened with all the adult memories of her future self as well as her massive powers she has no idea how to channel in a healthy and progressive way jean is scared shitless and she has every right to be but kitty was adamant to scold her and make her see the error of her ways i loved that piece of dialogue in the middle when she told jean that she cant put jean before the school and its students even if the school itself is named after her that shamed and humbled jean all at once she may have been an inspiring force in the future but right now shes a hot mess that needs to prove to everyone she can deal with her shit maturely and has got to stop resorting to using telepathy willy nilly every time she hates something and feels the need to control it usually involving the violation of a persons free will i think this is a matter of jean doing as charles xavier says and not do what he does because if were going to be brutally honest charles himself does manipulate students via telepathy and has blatantly done so on several occasions before and so hes kind of a hypocrite every time he preaches self control and respect over peoples free wills the man never claimed to be a saint though he does whatever is necessary to protect his students even from themselves and jean must learn to do the same good thing she has kitty by her side elsewhere mystique continues to cause trouble she poses as pepper pots at some point to blow something up and now the avengers are involved captain america thor scarlet witch and havok appeared before the ocf as the ocf accompanied by kitty decides to intervene mystiques plans and help out the next issue is guaranteed to be just as crazy and suspenseful because jean though she promised kitty to be good just cant help her fucking self and once again reads a certain avengers mind and the contents are pretty upsetting for her but hey im getting ahead of myself this issue is so awesome it deserves a perfect score recommended do read my reviews at',\n",
       " 'red the untold story is set in a mountainous secluded area near ravenswood mansion a centuries old home hidden in the woods or as author am hudson calls it the wolfs asylum a tight knit secretive community of full blooded wolves who live among humans its a place where no one in the wolf really knows the alpha of the pack but all see him as having a god like status it is a place where humans believe that wolves are just animals that roam in the hills and mountains and werewolves are nothing more than a myth this affords the wolf pack a great deal of privacy and anonymity during the nights when there is a full moon the community is a very believable and realistic world of the authors own creation it could almost be any small community based up in the hilly or mountainous lands its here in this setting that a quiet unremarkable and possibly mad human boy alex plain and his pet sacha meet a grief stricken lonely half wolf outcast named april redman better known to her family and friends as red meet for the first time red is dealing not only with grief over losing a parent but being pushed out of the pack as an outcast to the only world she has ever really known alex on the other hand is dealing with issues of his own with a forgetful father who loves to invent things and a severely disabled older brother named george who lives in many different worlds amazing worlds i might add georges world with the strange birds touched a chord very deep inside of me i found myself wanting it to be real in a very big way and that is unusual for me i think its perhaps because i have a severely disabled son and in some way without rhyme or reason i would like to think that he imagines such fantastic and amazing worlds as george does alex his brother george and their pet sacha become reds new best friends and they change her life and her perceptions of life in a way she never saw coming author am hudson creates beautiful and incredibly moving worlds for alex george and red to engage in when they are together and writes them into the story in such a way that this reader felt as if she was experiencing everything right along with all three of these characters she has even helped this reviewer to see that even the most mundane things in life can be magical one only needs to believe and this reviewer is a definite believer author am hudson has created an eclectic cast of small community characters that any reader will be able to identify with this gives them credibility and even more realism as the story and plot pull the reader right in and will refuse to let him or her go until long after the story is over characters such as red alex and george are easy to fall in love with while other characters such as reds peers are easy to dislike this reviewer has to admit that i was on the line with luther the packs alpha he sounded dreamy where looks were concerned but very old fashioned and even stand offish a bit but i wanted so much to give him the benefit of the doubt he had moments of being genuine and kind making me feel like i could fall in love with him and then he would do something horrendous and i wanted to beat the living tar out of him exactly what i love about am hudsons characters you go on a roller coaster ride of ups and downs twist and turns with each character and experience nearly every emotion in the book throughout the story these are the kind of characters that draw the reader more and more into the story and plot while holding their attention throughout author am hudson shows her master storytelling skills by being brilliant in how she brings her characters not only to life on the pages of this book but allows them each to tell his or her own story and this is just one aspect of the grand masterpiece that this reviewer has come to expect from author am hudson this reviewer read the book from start to finish in one sitting unable to put the book down and believe me i tried but i just couldnt stop at one or two chapters i had to continue reading until the very end and even then i wanted so much more of the story i can easily see this cast of characters being developed into a series just as the author did with her dark secrets series to be honest this reviewer believes this book too would be an excellent movie for the big screen to see the movie that played out in my mind while reading this book come to live on the big screen how exceptional that would be now as for the twists and turns and the revelations exposed oh my this reviewer never saw them coming until they smacked me right upside the head and left me in shock i can think of no better word for it as an avid reader who loves to be sucked into books i am also quite verbal while reading just ask my children and when i read these revelations i was yelling cussing crying and so much more before i fell into speechless silence it is exactly this kind of magnificent brilliance i have come to expect from author am hudson and she did not let me down author am hudson also has a unique way with the words she chooses to describe the characters places and such in her book and the prose she uses to this professional reviewer are both reminiscent of the way master story tellers write after countless hours of hair ripping frustration through trial and error this author does not mince her words but chooses them with care for each scene in the book as well as with any dialogue between characters the way she writes allowed this reviewer to not only see the story play out in my mind but as i said before allowed me to experience a roller coaster ride by the seat of my pants feeling every emotion that the characters felt and emotions i felt on behalf of the characters this author has a god given talent to be able to also use words to provoke the reader into believing he or she is utilizing all of his or her senses along with the characters that in itself equals a rare experience that will leave the reader needing more of the story at the books conclusion and wanting to read every other book this author has written this reviewer has been hooked on this authors books since she first started reading them this is the type of book that most professional reviewers pray to have land on their desks it is a true delight to the senses as well as for the imagination i rarely find authors who have such amazing talent in my line of work but i thank the powers of the universe for putting am hudsons books in my hands this is truly a must read for young adults and adults alike reviewed by holly newhouse for eternal book reviews',\n",

ihres zweitgeborenen des kindkonigs tommen mit der ungeliebten margery tyrell drehen sich ihre gedanken nur noch um die frage wie sie der kunftigen konigin eine falle stellen kann um deren regentschaft zu verhindern wahrend sie bei hof ihre intrigen spinnt beginnt es im suden erneut zu brodeln und die eisenmanner holen zu einem vernichtenden schlag gegen das reich aus cercei verliert zunehmend die fahigkeit zwischen freund und feind zu unterscheiden so verleiht sie den predigern des wieder erwachten glaubens grosse macht und ubersieht dabei wie leicht die gesponnenen ranke sich gegen sie selbst richten konnten spannung epische wucht und ideen dieser fantasy sindn nicht zu schlagen ein meisterwerk publishers weekly das cover auf diesem band ist das wappen der familie arryn zu sehen auf blauem grund erhebt sich ein adler auf dem banner steht der spruch hoch wie die ehre passend zum blauen wappen ist der titel des bandes sowie der name des autors auch in blau gehalten wie immer ein sehr stimmiges cover meine meinung ich muss erstmal sagen mein lieber mann was in diesem buch alles passiert das glaubt man kaum das leben in westeros ist wie eine achterbahnfahrt im dunkeln es geht auf und ab und nie weiss man was als nachstes passiert und wer diese fahrt ubersteht in jeder kurve fliegen ein paar mehr figuren raus und finden ihren tod in diesem teil wird es wieder einmal allzu deutlich dass keine figur sicher ist diese achterbahnfahrt unbeschadet zu uberlebenn nichteinmal wenn man tywinn lennister heisst und wenn es selbst so eine machtige person wie tywinn hinrafft da fragt man sich wie es cercei uberhaupt schaffen soll zunachst denkt man ja auch sie konnte es eventuell schaffen so ist sie doch eine sehr starke und auch nicht ganz dumme frau doch schnell merkt man eben dass sich cercei viel zu sehr von ihren rache gefuhlen und ihrem wunsch nach macht und anerkennung leiten lasst eine idee nach der anderen scheint ihr zu misslingen doch das merkt cercei nicht doch selbst ihr ehemals so treuer berater pycelle wendet sich gegen sie und versucht ihre regentschaft zu beenden auch kleinfinger ist beeindruckt wie schnell cercei es schafft alles zu grunde zu regieren cercei stolpert von einer idiotie in die nachste und lasst sich dabei von ihrem rat der tauben dummen und blinden unterstutzen ich habe immer erwartet dass sie das reich an den bettelstab bringen und sich selbst vernichten wurde aber ich hatte nie gedacht dass sie es so schnell schaffen wurde s kleinfinger zu alayne sansa das zeigt dass niemand wirklich erwartet hat dass es cercei jemals lange als konigin regentin aushalten wurde ich weiss noch nicht ob mir kleinfinger mittlerweile wieder sympathisch werden sollte oder nicht er schmiedet seine intrigen genauso schnell wie cercei nur ist er dabei weitaus geschickter und listiger es ist klar dass alles was er fur sansa tut nicht aus seiner liebe zu ihr oder ihrer mutter herruhren kann er strebt nach macht genau wie cercei nur scheint er dabei um einiges geschickter zu sein als diese wie ich schon sagte ist das leben in westeros und somit auch diese gesamte buchreihe wie eine achterbahn im dunkeln man sieht die hohepunkte nicht kommen und meist sind sie so schnell vorbei dass man sie nicht einmal bemerkt man rast sofort wieder auf den nachsten tiefpunkt zu und verliert dabei in einer scharfen kurve einen weiteren passagier der sich nicht halten kann und unsaft hinausgeschleudert wird einmal unten angekommen schleicht die bahn dann im schneckentempo nach oben um einen weiteren kurzen moment des sieges anzusteuern auch in diesem buch gibt es wieder jemanden zu betrauern und ich war wirklich sehr traurig daruber geschockt hat es mich nicht unbedingt denn es war in band schon abzusehen aber es war dennoch sehr traurig und zeigt erneut george r r martins skrupellosigkeit gegenuber den einzig guten menschen in diesem buch auch gegen ende war ich erneut sehr geschockt als es um brienne und pod ging einfach nur unglaublich was george r r martin sich da wieder ausgedacht hat und ich weiss dass sich buch erstmal bei den personen abspielen werden die in diesem buch kaum oder garnicht vorkamen also dany jon tyrion theon bis im englischen dann endlich ein neues buch rauskommt kann es noch dauern zwischen und soll es soweit sein und das meine lieben freunde ist dann doch eine sehr grosse zeitspanne da beruhigt es mich nicht einmal dass im april endlich die staffel game of thrones erscheinen soll bitte george r r martin bitte beeile dich mit dem schreiben wie immer vergebe ich diesem

       " 'im going to start with this statement this book took me way too long to finish honestly about months it was only pages in epub format yes i did read other books in between but honestly the hereos of olympus took me three days for three books and those books are like pages a piece why did this book take me so long i think its time for a list first let me tell you what i didnt particularly like the number of characters alright so the book started off with characters then the number started going up higher and higher and higher by the end of the book i couldnt remember who was who what species of mammal or not mammal they were and argh it was just confusing theres the herd of halfses a bunch of nomeds some rabbits badgers bertholds some fairies a number of birds a mouse i think there was a dolphin and maybe a turtle and a bunch of water warriors that i just remembered existed it was impossible to keep track of every character in the book as many had the same kind of formal voice i remember like of the i was introduced to throughout the book and that really isnt a good sign either the author needs to pay a little less attention to all the characters and focus on maybe or she needs to find a way to give every character a voice because by the end of the book i could just hear a collective mumble save for graces voice the repetition i know this is a middle grade novel but that doesnt mean i have to lower my expectations there are a number of middle grade books that id be down to read even now at the age of magyk by angie sage percy jackson and the olympians by rick riordan but this just wasnt one of them i found that the repetition in both the narrative and the dialogue was authors way of dumbing down the novel and little bit you do not have to repeat the great prophet times in one paragraph im not going to forget him within words something that happened throughout the book would be that one person or the narrator would explain something and then another person would repeat it we were under attack so we didnt see if he retreated back to the swamp or or if he exited via the gate said francis and worse still when we arrived the gate was already ajar it is possible that other nomeds may have escaped before we arrived oh no so adramalech and possibly other nomeds too may have gotten into the human world hazel cried note that we already know where the gate goes at this point note that i typed that exactly as it shows up in the book yes the ellipses are indeed there as are the capitalized words but thats a different point while i liked the repetition of names i felt like the repetition of the plot and story was too much it took up too much of the book and honestly wasnt necessary oh but alicia you may be able to understand it but what about the children honestly even as a kid i understood magyk fine and half of that book is spelt wrong on purpose i dont know if this whole repetition thing was intentional or not but as a kid i still would have been annoyed at this book the ellipses and capitalization i admit i use ellipses a lot granted that habits gotten better now i excessively use the word so and anyways i know i also use capitalization a lot too as you might have noticed at the beginning of my review however when you do that in books i just feel like the book is lacking something you shouldnt need to capitalize something to make the dialogue or narrative sound more intense i should get that from the writing the description etc you also shouldnt need to use an excessive amount of ellipses to add suspense hesitations alright i guess as long as its not excessive unfortunately the author used this method of writing throughout the novel and lost a little bit of credibility with me as a reader as the book when on two examples of this noooo cried zavier and it was therefore decided the magic must remain hidden from the humans forever i think i should add excessive use of exclamation marks to the list too though they didnt bother me as much as everything else did back to the point as you can see its just doesnt work that well it makes the book sound silly and the suspense she seems to be trying to aim for ends up falling flat on its face over explanation going hand in hand with repetition it was just so much telling and very little showing brinsop the chief dragonfly was a good friend of zaviers he knew him very well and he had sensed the urgency and panic in his voice you dont really need to go that far with the explanation if theyre good friends then of course theyd know each other well like the lack of consistency there are these magical creatures that guide us throughout the book one of which is name zavier if you didnt see it in the synopsis up there then ill give you a run down of what zaviers like hes the leader the head of one section of this animal realm called liberty he is very formal and supposedly has a very strong presence amongst the animals and generally this is how he speaks generally if any of you are willing to embark on such a journey and face its many dangers with me then put yourselves forward now and this is what he said that bothered me later oh my god yes i think it is and its still alive um dont get too excited you kind of sound like a year old girl now im sorry some of these phrases throughout the book just didnt fit and threw me off are these people formal not formal i mean somewhere in the book they used the word dude and while the character might have been young it just didnt fit at all into the story and when graces grandparents said fancy dress party that bothered me too these are older people they would say party or get together it just didnt fit and ugh flails breathes now for the things i did like the human world every time they flashed to graces world life was good aside from the grandparents saying fancy dress party these parts was pretty consistent i really liked graces character she was adorable as were her pets and just her behaviour in general was cute i loved this part because everything flowed well and there wasnt anything that really bothered me during these parts i loved learning about her family and the relationship she had with those around her as mentioned in the novel she had a kind of innocence about her that was enduring and sweet it was these parts that really helped me get through the book the nomeds despite the authors supposed attempt to dumb down the novel a bit she didnt cut down on the horror ish parts throughout the novel i loved these parts because of the action and the intensity of the moments some parts honestly freaked me out a little and i liked that it wasnt censored for any middle grade readers they also are an interesting force in all honestly i think the whole good over bad thing works really well in this book almost as if the nomeds are the bad within human kind while everyone is the good and the bad in both their world and theirs in taking over maybe im over thinking this or maybe im thinking that maybe this is a message to kids to do what we havent find the good find the innocence in mankind and make something of it the plot while it kind of dragged on i felt that the plot overall was really interesting and the concepts that faerydae puts on the table are really interesting it really gets me thinking as a teenager basically adult and i really wonder how kids will look at this if any kids actually will id love to see what theyd think of the book when it comes down to it world building while i really couldnt appreciate the names of each part of liberty i really loved how faerydae created the world of liberty from her descriptions i could picture a world without humans a world in which animals of all kinds flourish and co exist its amazing how well the author put together the world of liberty even the human world in which grace lived i found was created well end of compliments and rants overall i really liked the ideas that faerydae had however i wish faerydaed done a better job of putting them together and executing the story that they wanted to tell i think the part that was hardest to get past was the writing within the story hopefully that can be polished in the next book aside from that though it was a fairly large obstacle for me to get over as a reader the story was captivating enough to keep me reading note that i do have a high tolerance and a great amount of determination when it comes to finishing books this one i almost quit on multiple occasions while it was hard i did liked the story and the world that was created all in all i hope that the next book is better than this one at least writing wise plot characters world building writing cover overall ebook copy received from troubador publishing ltd via

thus i was sure i would love like this novel and while i certainly did immensely enjoy it i do believe i am the most surprised out of anyone to find that this book for all its brilliant concepts failed to wow me in its execution or ultimate message which i believe to be its downfall i find it difficult to summarize unwind in just a few phrases but long story short this is a dystopian novel in which the issue of abortion has been solved by a new concept called unwinding in this world children between the ages of can be unwound and their body parts used for medical purposes thus these children are not believed to actually be dead as some part of their body lives on in someone else unwind revolves around the stories of connor whose parents signed him up to be unwound after he got into one too many school fights risa who is an orphan and lev who is a tithe and has been preparing to be unwound every since he was born when connor runs away to escape being unwound planning to stay in hiding until he is and a free man from the law his life becomes inexplicably interwoven with that of risa and lev and the three must struggle to escape authorities or face not death but unwinding in all honesty unwind had a lot to like for one i loved the concept and the pacing is phenomenal making you flip the pages frantically and switch from connor lev risa and a couple of other perspectives as well i think a lot of people have difficulty grasping the reality of this concept and while i agree that a war over abortion is a little far fetched overall i thought this was handled extremely well if fathers in the middle east can sacrifice their daughters to polygamous and cruel marriages then surely parents are certainly able to sign up their children to be unwound after all theyre not really dead are they so you see i loved this idea and found it to be so psychologically intriguing connor and risas perspectives were certainly interesting but seeing what a tithe like lev had to say after essentially being brain washed his entire life or meeting characters who had a part of someone elses brain in their mind was all very imaginative and interesting and i loved it yet for all my praise of this novel and its writing and its psychologically scarring elements because there is one gruesome scene that may throw off other readers what really brought down this novel was its ultimate message every author has a point theyre trying to make in their work and from the surface the point of unwind is quite obvious as a rebellion against this cruel and unnatural mode of living slowly begins yet there were so many discrepancies that made me sit back and think after finishing this book and while i loved reading it i dont think its a book that deserves all the praise it receives yes its a new and original idea yes the writing is great yes the characters are well developed but lets look at what this story ultimately says note yes there are spoilers ahead but they will not ruin the story for you in fact if you havent read this novel they will most likely not make much sense so you can read them without any harm but if you dont wish to read them skip below to wear the semi spoilers end first of all connor receives an arm from an unwound at the end of this novel which seems to take away the entire purpose of it you see connor is running away from being unwound only to receive a part of that procedure because hes in trouble which is a huge irony and red flag for the ultimate message i think the saddest thing though is that this unwound arm he receives was only a part of the tale to further the romance which isnt even that great to begin with its disturbing and bothered me immensely next lev i loved lev because of the conflicting emotions he went through as a tithe but ultimately he never realized the value of life and living for a tithe being an unwound means doing a great service and once lev understood the horror he was about to face instead of embracing life he became a human bomb to destroy an unwinding hospital facility okay this is good right yes hes destroying these horrible facilities but at the cost of his own life because he still does not see that being alive is better than being unwound or dead and it is his near death and not near unwinding experience which enables him to see the light which again contradicts the true message of this novel one last example the admiral the admiral unwound his son but wanted to stop it from happening at the last minute but since he couldnt he spent the rest of his life finding out where the parts of his son had gone and gathering them together not the parts the people who had the parts on the surface this seems very sweet since hes just trying to be with his son again but really it isnt sweet at all what shusterman essentially does is show us that yes unwinds are alive because even if their body parts are not all put together by assembling a group of people who contain the same body parts as one person that makes the person whole and alive once again the admiral was essentially speaking to his sons brain and seeing his sons lungs of asthma and hearing his sons voice so how was he not alive the point of this novel was to show that there are things worse than death such as unwinding and ceasing to be yourself but then the author went and proved that unwinding really wasnt that bad after all i think what shusterman meant to do was something much different with this scene but its execution and the way it is ultimately interpreted fails to really add to the message hes building up with his story end semi spoilers i liked this book i really did it was such an original and creative take on a very pressing and modern issue but there were way too many plot holes in it some of the rebellion mobs made no sense and many of the secondary characters were vastly underdeveloped too i would still recommend this as most people seem to have overlooked or skipped the plot holes but i simply cannot i still dont know what this author planned to achieve with this book only because so much of it was contradictory but hopefully the sequel will be better you can

       " 'this really isnt going to be a book review but more of an informative collection of my thoughts for those of you who are fans of wards black dagger series hopefully this post will help you determine whether or not it would be worth your while to purchase it first up the guide is actually pretty hefty weighing in with a whopping total of pages the book is trade paperback size and actually has a small font im going to guess its a font so as you can surmise there is quite a bit of reading material for fan perusal i will list in order the guides table of contents and comment briefly about each section novella father mine this short story features zsadists struggle with becoming a father and accepting that he is good enough for nalla and bella i thought it was fine zsadist isnt my favorite brother but he doesnt get on my nerves either fans of zsadist i am sure will enjoy father mine while those of you who are sick of zsadist should probably just stay away the brotherhood dossiers there is a dossier for each of the six books currently published it starts out with a fact sheet about the brother featured in the book then there is a questionnaire that the brother filled out ward also interviews the brother then she talks about the writing process for the book and her favorite or not so favorite parts this was actually quite enlightening she lets the reader get a feel for how she developed the stories and what her writing process is like for those of you who are thinking of writing your own book this section is a must for you i think you will find it very interesting also for fans who were disappointed with the direction certain books went or didnt go she addresses these issues as well i found some of her rational and answers to these fan complaints to be less than stellar and a little on the weak side but still it was interesting to read about tips for writers and the original proposal i cant really comment on this section because i didnt read the writer tips i just skipped right on by it since i dont plan on being a writer i did read the proposal ward puts in the guide exactly what she sent out to publishers so again it is very interesting to see the beginning product and what it eventually evolved into deleted scenes there are five of them they were all good the deleted scene from lover enshrined with phury and cormia i think i liked better than what was in the book go figure kicks and giggles this section is where ward takes her favorite lines from each of the six books they are fun to read through and make me want to read these books over again brothers on the board she has recreated the message board posts that occurred when the brothers posted in the past she also has the posts that pertain to lassiter i am not a member of wards message board so reading through all of these was new to me i also want to mention the character lassiter some people have criticized ward for lassiters appearance on the message boards and then his surprise appearance in lover enshrined lassiter was a surprise to those readers who arent a member of wards message boards me included in the book lassiters appearance raised more questions than answers at least this was the case with me after reading lover enshrined i was confused as to his identity and his relationship with the brothers after reading the message board posts involving lassiter i am still confused as to his identity and his relationship with the brothers but now i think this is exactly what j r ward wants it seems to me his background is supposed to be a mystery and one that will hopefully be revealed in upcoming books slices of life these are brief scenes that ward posted on the message board one is movie night another one and personally my favorite thing out of the guide is a scene with wrath he has been feeling weighed down by his kingly responsibilities and feels he is losing the warrior in him whoa buddy that was a steamy excerpt there are a few more but im not going to go into detail about them question and answer with j r ward here ward answers questions that readers have asked her over the years at this point in the guide though i found it somewhat redundant its also relatively brief then there is a brotherhood timeline a table of abbreviations and a listing of the old language alphabet the brothers interview j r ward it is exactly what the title says it is at this point in the guide i have come to the conclusion that ward eat sleeps and drinks the brotherhood quite frankly i dont know whether i should be disturbed or fascinated the way she describes these figments of her imagination and brings them to life takes an immense amount of talent in my mind she has created a captivating series i have really enjoyed these books with the exception of vishouss book but i am not going to get into that right now in memoriam this is a brief scene into the life of tohr and wellsie that takes place between lover eternal and lover awakened last but not least the guide ends with an excerpt from lover avenged well that about sums up the guide now i have the distinct urge to go and reread this series beginning with the book that started it all dark lover must hold off',\n",

arc review from the author first line a shot of lust hit him hard as he looked into the brightest blue eyes hed ever seen memorable scenes opening scene of the book it started with a bang and never let up jamies solo sexy times scenes can i say hot chelsea and bradens first time together scene culmination point of a lot of sexual tension and chemistry chelsea has had a crush on braden marley for years but he keeps shooting her down and chelsea is getting frustrated with it and with his every attempt to keep other male merfolk at a distance braden has had a hard time resisting chelsea and now that shes not taking away the temptation by having to stay in town instead of leaving for college it takes all his willpower not to give in the arrival of jamie powell offers possibilities for a solution to bradens dilemma only not in the way he expected chelsea is a young woman who has too much responsibility to carry on her shoulders her college plans are hindered by financial family problems but she is protective of her family and carries the burden by herself chelsea is stubborn willful vivacious and a very smart cookie braden is the sheriff of jaffrey cove hes a big bald giant who loves to be in control hes commanding and straight to the point his only weakness is his forbidden attraction to the young chelsea which he tries very hard to ignore and resist jamie is an archaeologist who comes to jaffrey cove to do an assessment of a marine artifact nautical collection inherited by alexia heroine tidal wave book hes a little scatterbrained and sometimes forgetful about mundane things jamie is my kind of hero very observant sweet calm and analytical but theres also that very seductive and sexual edge to him that fascinates and attracts there were so many moments in whirlpool where i wanted to say to him come to pearl ill make you feel better from the start vivian arend pulled me straight into this story contrary to tidal wave which took me a few pages to get into and stayed slow paced well into it whirlpool reeled me in straight away and kept me utterly captivated i really liked how the world building that was understandably prominent in tidal wave was toned down to a subtler and less intrusive level this definitely benefitted the pace and the story the small plot of the crazies vandalism spree was intriguingly woven through the romance and resolved wonderfully and in a way i never saw coming i was speculating about what could have caused it but never thought it to be what it turned out to be i also loved how once again vivian arend created a love triangle that totally worked though i was feeling a bit sorry for jamie at the beginning but he got his and got it good in the course of the story and my consolation was definitely not needed anymore i also admire the solution for the practical sides of this threesome and the way it still was a great hea though not a conventional one the build up of the romance is excellently done vivian arend created wonderful tension building it up slowly and when the climax it was building up to came it was titillating though as might be known by now i am not a m m reader i did enjoy the subtle m m parts of the menage in whirlpool they were beautifully done and not once did i feel uncomfortable with it kudos for vivian arend for joining the two other authors lorelei james and lauren dane on my shelves who managed to keep me in my comfort zone while reading male on male sexy times opposites and sex on sticks jamie and brady and bubbly charming chelsea carried the story wonderfully and provide some scorch the pages scenes that are guaranteed to set your reader on fire and keep you warm on a cold winter night ms arend turned up the heat for this one and i cant say i had any objection to it the sensual heat bar was set high from the first chapter and never diminished and her writing never fails to draw me in and keep me glued to the pages favorite quote braden tweaked her nose and she smacked his hand away with a laugh okay baby we give youre right and we promise not to organize your life without you again whats our punishment you want us to take you out to dinner i want to watch she crawled up on the back of the couch jamie flushed bright red and braden grinned from ear to ear watch yes jamie she fluttered her hand at him just pretend im not here and go back to what you were doing before i came home her sex tingled in anticipation you dont want to join us braden asked giving her a slow clothing melting stare from top to bottom and the tingle increased to an electric pulse oh ill let you know when i want in on the action she crossed her arms and tapped her lips i think you should start by taking everything off makes it easier for the watching you know jamie leaned over her to nuzzle at her neck caging her on either side with his strong arms youre a naughty girl she reached down and pulled his shirt from his slacks you braden naked now',\n",

       " 'daphne du maurier is great at creating characters who all appear to be respectable citizens but in reality are anything but another author who is a master at such character craft is shirley jackson but jackson whom i also adore is a little more brutal in her approach while du maurier stitches her ruthless characters in chic subtlety this was one of the reasons why i loved rebecca so much because it poked nicely at the british aristocracy exposing what kind of destructive and maniacal minds sip afternoon tea each day as du maurier was a socialite back in her day she no doubt saw a different side to the rich and bored and in prose decided to play puppet master placing these posh people in less than savory situations and letting the sinister shenanigans ensue with every paragraph you can hear du maurier cackling as she types and scribbles away du maurier is also good at evoking an unsettled sense of dread in her stories and she twists her plotlines to where youre often questioning the events presented as the conclusion looms ahead even if the conclusion is kind of ridiculous or even a little bit confusing youre still wondering if all that you read was based in reality or if the character is experiencing some sort of unchecked paranoia for all the absorbing mind games that get played the only wrinkle in her work is that du maurier heightens the fear by lots and lots of words and if you dont have the patience for it youll be bored to tears im one of those people who appreciates du mauriers slower paced prose as it gives time to read her fine crafted sentence and enjoy every delicious and chilling twist she throws at you so if youre thinking of skimming ahead do so at your own peril because you might miss a gem line or moment of spontaneity that yanks the story into a new creepy direction i just love how she builds up her stories into this crazy wtf frenzy and believe me dont look now is filled with lots of wtfs the stories in dont look now have a connected theme where the characters are all either on holiday or trekking towards uncharted territories that have yet to be discovered this adds to the ominous nature of the book as each character has to combat unknown forces away from the familiar comforts of home its why this collection also doubles as a great travel narrative as du maurier becomes a tour guide to such exotic locales loading on descriptive images that make you feel as if you too are eating sumptuous delicacies in a venice restaurant or taking in the scenic views of the holy land after being disenchanted with the new wave of psychological mysteries that seem to pander to readers more than stimulate their minds looking at you the girl on the train dont look now was a breath of fresh intrigue short stories are usually not everybodys jive and so few collections really do hit the spot for me personally but this collection is above the usual and worth a shot if you like your horror on a more psychological level this is a collection i have wanted to read for some time and i was glad i found this book and found it in one of the most unlikely places ever in a book filled chest that belonged to my late grandmother while this has nothing to do with the book itself for me the way i found this collection just adds to the mysterious air of the book for me because even though i knew my grandmother was a long retired english teacher and a voracious reader i didnt know she got her daphne du maurier on too like grandmother like granddaughter i see ive noticed that there are various versions of this book but my version included the stories as follows dont look now this is the books main attraction and it involves a grieving couple who are visiting venice in order to forget about the recent tragic death of their daughter while there they become acquainted with two odd twin sisters one of the sisters possesses psychic powers and she informs them that the couple must leave venice immediately adding to the couples trouble there is a killer on the loose like the narrowed rain slicked cobblestone streets of venice the twists and tension in this story wind around you but while it plays great mind games with you the ending was little absurd and kind of a letdown even with a lame ending i still enjoyed getting wrapped up in the mystery i have seen the film version that stars julie christie and donald sutherland and while the film receives more of a reputation for its graphic sex scene well graphic for the time its pretty cheesy by todays standards the eerie atmosphere it possesses like its source material deserves more praise the breakthrough this story is about an engineer that becomes involved with a scientist who is attempting to bring the dead into the land of the living through alternative vessels though the scientific aspects are a bit far fetched a machine that transfers souls and the theories that are brought up are explained at surface level it was an interesting tale that explores immortality identity and how humans often love to play god even though we know hes got all the cards i actually enjoyed this story as ive always had a weird fascination on how we define the boundaries between life and death theres also some great symbolism going on because if you know some greek mythology the machines name will sound familiar and bring further depth into the subject matter not after midnight longing for solitude leisure and a place to paint a school teacher goes on holiday to crete greece but instead of finding relaxation he becomes embroiled with the sinister goings on of a very odd american couple this story was my favorite of the bunch the build up of this is just superb as it envelopes and seals you into the protagonists growing paranoia by the end you really dont know what he has seen or has made himself see and its this kind of sinister feeling that gives du maurier gothic authority i really love the vagueness going on in this story because you leave the story with more questions than answers your imagination just running wild a borderline case theres a great tonal shift in this story which perfectly shows how effortless and fluid du maurier can be with words it begins as gothic tale where a year old acting student is searching around a gloomy rural irish township for her late fathers estranged military buddy then a sharp left turn is taken when its discovered why her fathers friend is a border line case it is discovered her fathers friend is a commander of the ira and considering the time era that this was written this reveal is handled with a compassionate supportive air a couple of complex twists this takes some of which im still trying to wrap my head around it goes on a little long with the writing falling apart near the end but i really enjoyed the first half of it as i got vibes of richard connells the most dangerous game and the arthur penn film dead of winter due to the isolated island mansion its oddball inhabitants and the weird circumstances surrounding their own private hell the way of the cross heavy on religious themes and light on the horror this story follows a group of individuals on a tour of the holy land during passover the tour gets off on the wrong foot when their tour guide and pastor falls ill and is replaced with a young and less educated pastor who is questioning his own faith and wants to be anywhere but where he is at the moment each character on the tour comes to face their faith in various enlightening fashions which subtly mirror the life and acts of christ du maurier does wrap things up nicely as after all the characters begin to resolve their plights and conflicts with one another there is a chance for redemption for them all in the end even though i liked the message of this story and consider myself a spiritual person a lot of the religious names and imagery kind of flew over my head at some points to where it made it somewhat difficult to find footing in it maybe ill revisit this story at a later date and read between the lines a little closer but for now it wasnt my favorite in the bunch and brought the collection down just a tad for me',\n",
       " 'no remorse is a self published debut by ian walkley that in itself will be enough to put some people off but the greatest compliment i can give this is that it feels in no way either self published or a debut the issue with many books like this is that either they miss a good editor or the print quality is poor not so here here we have an ex delta operator joining a black ops team that target the funds of bad guys and through use of cunning and top end technology syphon off large chunks as our hero mac joins the team he is also running a personal mission to track down the daughter of a friend who has been taken as part of a human trafficking ring as it is with these stories the storylines collide as mac discovers that the teams current target is also the man behind the trafficking ring and a lot more a satisfying although slightly abrupt end completes an entertaining read the pacing is good and the characterisation works there is good balance between the action and the plot being driven forward some aspects are not for the faint hearted but it is also the kind of book where you know what you are going to get from reading the back cover there are some elements here that are similar to robert crais recent taken but this takes a wider perspective and throws a lot more into the mix this is a good debut and the author is unlucky that a publisher has not picked this up i have certainly read top ten books in this genre that were nowhere near as good as this its well worth picking up i was provided with a copy of the book for reviewing purposes',\n",

       " 'i want to start by saying that the last fourth perhaps even third of the book was pretty good if i were reviewing a novel that had started out the way it ended i would probably be saying something completely different however that is not how article began article begins with some seriously flawed world building that not only creates a bad novel but also encourages some very bad political ideas and behaviors the premise of article is that a totalitarian theocracy controls what amounts to a dystopic contemporary america as a result of a war the war the war apparently included some bombing of major us cities but left other areas almost completely untouched it was severe enough to warrant the re establishment of the draft and wiped out our basic media infrastructure however at least as far as can be inferred from the novel it did not affect mexico or canada also it lasted less than three years there is very little information about the war provided but what is provided is conflicting in nature the physical effects of the war imply an external other that this war is with a nation that is geographically independent of the us however the socio political effects do not match up with this sort of war american voters are in actuality on a spectrum we have liberals and conservatives on each extreme jockeying for control hoping to sway the moderate independents in the middle to their side each election the result therefore is that on really polar issues the country is often divided into fairly equal diametrically opposed sides with a huge mass of not as concerned people in the middle that is part of why our politics tend to take a pendulum type pattern it takes something extreme to move the middle in order to have such an extreme neo conservative government take power we would have had to have experienced a civil war or a long sustained war with an external other neither of these options are even remotely possible with the way the war is described seriously bush barely pulled of the popular vote against a weak opponent three years after while fighting two ongoing wars therefore a contemporary america that could be interchanged for nazi germany with a morality militia reminiscent of the iranian militias and the republican guard is really implausible based on simmons premise on this shaky ground she then proceeds to build every liberals worst nightmare of america each flash point is pulled directly from our current headlines divided perfectly down the r d line however most of what simmons shows in the early part of the novel while frustratingly offensive to most liberals would have the average conservative saying yeah and this is where i have to ask myself who precisely simmons intended as her audience i mean i get that she anticipates them to be teenagers hence the young adult label however no age group has uniformly similar beliefs there are conservative teenagers liberal teenagers and those who could really care less her portrayal of the liberal characters is just sympathetic enough and the conservatives just offensive enough to alienate most conservative readers if she was trying to change anyones political beliefs by showing some of the hazier implications of conservative ideology which she admittedly does later in the novel she fails by alienating her conservative readers early on i doubt they even finish it the worst part if they do it only reaffirms the often held belief of the religious conservative that all liberals are out to malign them as evil simply for being religious and conservative more dangerously though is what i feel this book does to the liberal reader the further the book progresses the worse it gets article is perfectly calibrated to push every liberal hot button it makes your blood boil it makes you angry you feel frustrated rage and what those conservatives are doing to our country in a book it is in short fear and hate mongering yes these issues echo our current newspapers but we are still working on it there are equal and opposite reactions from the other side as well the only way to make a democracy work without tearing ourselves apart is to encourage discourse when we are busy whipping ourselves up into a fervor over imagined slights it discourages discourse in a serious way america has real problems right now womens rights are seriously in danger religious freedom is daily being called into question the lgbtq community is still systematically disenfranchised racial equality has not yet been obtained we have problems but books like this books that encourage righteous anger but offer no answers contribute to the problem not the solution this is why in my opinion if you want to tackle serious issues in current events through fiction it is best to create artificial distance by making the characters aliens or dragons creating a futuristic or fantastical setting books like this are too personal you cant get people to listen to you if they are busy defending themselves add to these problems a heroine who is truly too stupid to live and who is utterly clueless about basic world history if she believes all she professes to through the book she also had to basically have lived in a box during the war to treat chase the way she did when he had to become physically violent to protect her perhaps i am reading too much into this but i eventually thought of ember as an allegorical representation of how the politically active often view the clueless mass of moderates in the middle i cant even count how many times i have seen people on both sides of the fence nearly scream in frustration how do they not see what is going on i was definitely screaming that at ember in simmons defense once she quite pushing her political agenda the book really did get quite enjoyable i really liked chase and the action was fast paced and engrossing i just really didnt like how simmons got there i dont think i will be recommending this book',\n",
